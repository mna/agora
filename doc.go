// Agora is a dynamically typed, garbage collected, embeddable programming language.
//
// It is built in the Go programming language, and is meant to provide a syntactically
// similar, loose, dynamic and fun companion to the statically typed, machine compiled
// Go language - somewhat like Lua is to C.
//
// Installation
//
// 			go get github.com/PuerkitoBio/agora/...
//
// Resources
//
// This source code documentation is meant for explaining the internals of the agora
// programming language: its runtime and compiler, its command-line tools and its
// native Go API provided for embedding agora within a Go program.
//
// Other documentation exist for the agora language itself, the stdlib, installation,
// and such.
//
// See https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/agora#readme for more details.
